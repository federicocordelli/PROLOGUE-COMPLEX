**[E-POETRY. A digital visualization of Songs Of Innocence and Songs Of Experience by William Blake](https://federicocordelli.github.io/DIG-HOME/)** is a university project of 4 students: Alvise Aspesi, Federico Cordelli, Davide Perucchini and Enzo Giovanni Taboada Fung for the course of Digital Culture at the Politecnico di Milano. The aim is to transform William Blake's The Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience into a collaborative E-Literature project so that users can feel free to represent the poems as they see fit. We started this project from the poem The Shepherd, adding images, sounds, and animations, but this is only a small step. The project aims to enrich itself over time.
